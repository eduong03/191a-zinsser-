# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Eddie Duong

In chapters two and three of, On Writing Well, William Zinsserâ€™s main point is that writing simple, clear English is more effective than using big fancy words. Clear writing comes from clear thinking. Therefore writers should constantly ask themselves what they are trying to say so that every word serves a purpose. To prevent sentences from becoming excessively cluttered, every word must be reexamined to help get rid of meaningless jargon. Rewriting is a significant tool when it comes to writing English because it assists writers in simplifying their work and strengthening its context.
